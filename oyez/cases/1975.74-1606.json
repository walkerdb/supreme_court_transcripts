  "conclusion": "<p>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, writing for a 6-3 majority, reversed the Wisconsin Supreme Court and remanded. The Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause did not guarantee the teachers an independent review of the decision to terminate them. The fact that the school district had negotiated with the teachers earlier and had knowledge of the events surrounding the strike did not make them incapable of giving the teachers due process.</p>\n<p>Justice Potter Stewart dissented, arguing that the case should be remanded for a determination of whether the school board must consider the reasonableness of the strike considering its own actions, or whether it is free to exercise its discretion when deciding to terminated teachers. Justice William J. Brennan and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.</p>\n",
  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Teachers at the Hortonville Joint School District went on strike when negotiations over employment contracts broke down. Wisconsin law prohibited strikes by public employees. The School District invited the teachers to return to work several times, and a few teachers accepted the offer. After about two weeks of striking, the school board set disciplinary hearings for the teachers who continued to strike. An attorney for the teachers indicated that the teachers wished to be treated as a group and argued that the school board was not sufficiently impartial to be able to exercise discipline over the teachers. The attorney argued that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required an independent, unbiased decision maker. The school board still voted to terminate the teachers, but invited them to reapply for their jobs. One teacher did so and returned to work. The remaining teachers were replaced.</p>\n<p>The fired teachers sued the school district in Wisconsin state court alleging that their termination violated their due process. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the school district, holding that due process was not violated because the teachers admitted to being on strike in violation of state law after receiving adequate notice and a hearing. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed, holding that the Due Process Clause required the teachers' conduct and the school board’s decision to be evaluated by an impartial decision maker.</p>\n",
