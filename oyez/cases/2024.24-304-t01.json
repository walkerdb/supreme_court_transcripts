Plaintiffs who don't want to use kiosks don't have standing to challenge how kiosks work any more than a vegan has standing to challenge how a restaurant defines a medium rare steak. As a result, the Court needs to assess whether each of the 8,000 to 112,000 class members actually want to use kiosks, and that will necessarily swamp any common issues, as the D.C. and First Circuits correctly held in the Rail Freight and Asacol cases.

It's specifically what Judge Kayatta addressed in the Asacol case, where he said, look, when it comes to issues of preference, you can't simply rely on affidavits because -- unless the defendants stand up and say we concede that all of the affidavits are true. Instead, a defendant, if it has a good-faith basis to do so, has a right to contest the veracity of affidavits. Here, given how implausible it would be if 112,000 people came forward and said we all preferred to use the kiosks, given the inherent implausibility of that, I think we would have a very strong basis to say:  No, we want to test every one of those affidavits. We're going to spend, you know, anywhere between two and 10 years addressing the threshold question of jurisdiction, necessarily going to overwhelm any common issue."

So another way to look at this would be for you to say, okay, there might be some procedural quirks, maybe they flow from the Ninth Circuit's odd, you know, way of deciding what orders are appealable, what orders are operative, but that, here, you should just decide the question presented on the facts as they've come up to you because you do have a judgment in front of you from the Ninth Circuit."

And I think my answer is the same as Mr. Francisco's and, frankly, the same that Respondents give in their brief or as I read it, which is:  If there is a class-wide, manageable mechanical way to separate them as in, for example, TransUnion there would have been or as in Justice Jackson's Verizon hypothetical there would be a manageable class-wide way to do it, we think that's fine. Rule 23 doesn't preclude that certification. But what we are saying is that Rule 23 needs to be followed at certification and then throughout the litigation."

So, for example, if there's, say, an antitrust class and the allegation is price-fixing and the class is defined as all purchasers of the product during the period of price-fixing where there were super-competitive prices, we think that would be a valid class definition even if there's some idiosyncratic person that likes paying higher prices for whatever reason. Or, if it's a product liability, you know, a defective product that injured people, you know, all purchasers of the product who suffered the injury would be a valid class in our view, even if there's somebody who, because of the injury, you know, missed a test and then --that he didn't study for but then did the makeup test later on, got a better grade, got a Supreme Court clerkship at the end of it, and therefore wasn't injured, I --you know, those sorts of idiosyncratic things, we agree, that's not what Rule 23 requires, but --"

And that seems to be what you are saying. I appreciate that there are certain other cases where the Court has picked out various issues and said either you've gotten it wrong or right on commonality and that you would like for this to be one of them.

So, if the Court finds its way to reaching the question presented and writes an advisory opinion, and it's what we think it would be, the advisory opinion should hold that at the class certification stage, the proper inquiry is whether there will be an administratively feasible mechanism to weed out the uninjured. Consistent with centuries of historical practice from the chancery courts at the time of the Constitution's ratification to now, it is the representative who is actually before the court, not the absentees, who must prove the existence of an Article III case or controversy at the outset. But, if we are here to police the jurisdiction of the federal courts under Article III, we should probably start with this case in this Court. LabCorp now concedes that any appeal of the August order on which LabCorp's arguments have exclusively relied was not actually in the case in the court of appeals and, therefore, isn't within this Court's certiorari jurisdiction. In its reply, LabCorp has shifted gears and attempted to reorient its challenge to the May order that is concededly no longer in effect and that is not harming LabCorp. But any appeal of that superseded order is moot under the general rule that interlocutory appeals from superseded orders are moot."

And it -- it principally arises in cases -- it happens a lot in antitrust cases and other kinds of cases where the plaintiffs' method of proof relies on an economic model about a counterfactual world.

That was the language that Justice Story used, and it's the same language that Rule 23 uses.
