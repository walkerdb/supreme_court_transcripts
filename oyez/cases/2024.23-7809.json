  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In 1998, Ruben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death for his involvement in the robbery and killing of Escolastica Harrison. After multiple appeals and habeas corpus petitions, Gutierrez sought DNA testing of evidence from the crime scene under Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Chapter 64. Texas courts repeatedly denied his requests, in part because Chapter 64 does not authorize testing when exculpatory results might only affect punishment or sentencing.</p>\n<p>In 2019, Gutierrez filed a federal lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Cameron County District Attorney Luis V. Saenz and others challenging the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing procedures. Gutierrez argued that Chapter 64 improperly limited the rights granted in another Texas statute (Article 11.071) governing successive habeas applications for death row inmates. The district court agreed, ruling that the interaction between these laws violated procedural due process by making the right to bring a successive habeas application to claim innocence of the death penalty \u201cillusory.\u201d The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that Gutierrez had no standing to make this claim and vacated the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Does a Texas death-row inmate have standing to sue the state over its refusal to grant access to DNA testing under a law that allows such testing only when the person can demonstrate that exculpatory results would have prevented their conviction?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>Petitioner Ruben Gutierrez has standing to bring his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim challenging Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing procedures under the Due Process Clause. Justice Sonia Sotomayor authored the majority opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Prisoners convicted in state court have a liberty interest in demonstrating their innocence with new evidence under state law. When states create postconviction procedures, they can create rights to other procedures essential to realizing those rights. Under Skinner v. Switzer, a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 1983 due process claim alleging that a state's DNA testing statute unconstitutionally prevents him from obtaining testing, even though he cannot directly challenge state court denials of his testing motions. To bring such a suit, the prisoner must demonstrate judicial standing to sue.</p>\n<p>The standing analysis follows Reed v. Goertz, which requires three elements. First, Gutierrez adequately alleged an injury: the prosecutor's denial of access to DNA evidence. Second, prosecutor Saenz caused this injury by refusing to release evidence in his custody for testing. Third, if a federal court declares Texas\u2019s procedures unconstitutional, that judgment would eliminate Saenz\u2019s justification for denying testing, thereby removing the barrier between Gutierrez and the evidence. The declaratory judgment would change the parties\u2019 legal status and redress Gutierrez\u2019s injury by eliminating the allegedly unlawful basis for the denial.</p>\n<p>The Fifth Circuit erred in two fundamental ways. First, it improperly focused on the limited declaratory judgment the District Court ultimately issued rather than on Gutierrez\u2019s broader complaint. Gutierrez\u2019s complaint challenged not just Article 64\u2019s limitation to actual innocence claims, but multiple barriers the statute creates\u2014including its virtually insurmountable standard for parties to crimes, its refusal to consider new evidence, and its prohibition on testing solely to challenge death eligibility. Standing depends on the allegations in the complaint, not on the particular relief a district court later grants.</p>\n<p>Second, the Fifth Circuit wrongly transformed the redressability inquiry into speculation about whether the prosecutor would ultimately provide the evidence. Under Reed, a declaratory judgment need only eliminate the prosecutor\u2019s reliance on the challenged provision as a justification for denying testing. The Court rejected the notion that redressability requires certainty about the ultimate outcome. That a prosecutor might find other reasons to deny testing\u2014just as the prosecutor in Reed had multiple grounds for denial\u2014does not defeat standing to challenge specific reasons as unconstitutional. Courts regularly allow plaintiffs to challenge improper legal grounds for discretionary decisions even when the decision-maker might reach the same result for different reasons.</p>\n<p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined all but Part II.B.2 of the majority opinion and authored a concurring opinion arguing that the Court should have reversed based solely on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s failure to consider the full scope of relief requested in Gutierrez\u2019s complaint.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas authored a dissenting opinion, arguing that the Court lacks authority to intervene because state-created postconviction procedures cannot create \u201cliberty interests\u201d under the Due Process Clause\u2019s original meaning.</p>\n<p>Justice Samuel Alito authored a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Thomas and Gorsuch, arguing that the majority distorts the Reed standard and that Gutierrez cannot show his injury would be redressed given the Texas courts\u2019 multiple independent grounds for denying DNA testing.</p>\n",
