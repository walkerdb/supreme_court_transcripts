  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In April 2006, two men got into a fight with several other people\u00a0on a street in the Bronx. Shortly thereafter, someone opened fire with a 9 millimeter handgun, killing a child in a passing car. Three eyewitnesses identified Nicholas Morris as the shooter. Police searched Morris\u2019s home and found a 9 millimeter cartridge and ammunition for a .357 revolver. They arrested him the next day. He was indicted for the child\u2019s murder and for possession of a 9 millimeter handgun, but the prosecution ended in a mistrial. Instead\u00a0of trying him again, the State offered Morris a deal: If Morris pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm at the scene of the shooting, the State would request that the murder charge be dismissed with prejudice. Morris accepted the plea deal. However, the State charged Morris with possessing a .357 revolver at the scene of the shooting, rather than a 9 millimeter established as the murder weapon. The prosecution lacked sufficient evidence to establish possession of the .357 revolver, so Morris supplied the evidence through his own statement.</p>\n<p>In 2013, the state charged Darrell Hemphill, the petitioner in this case who was also present at the fight in the Bronx, with the murder. At trial, Hemphill elicited testimony that police had recovered the 9 millimeter cartridge on Morris\u2019s nightstand hours after the shooting. In response, the prosecution sought to introduce into evidence Morris\u2019s statement that he possessed a .357 revolver at the scene. Based in part on this evidence, Hemphill was found guilty of second-degree murder and sentenced to twenty-five years to life in prison. An appellate court affirmed the conviction, as did New York\u2019s highest court.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>When, if ever, does a criminal defendant who \u201copens the door\u201d to evidence that would otherwise be barred by the rules of evidence also forfeit his right to exclude evidence otherwise barred by the Confrontation Clause?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>A criminal defendant does not forfeit his confrontation right merely by making an argument in his defense based on a testimonial out-of-court statement like a plea allocution.</p>\n<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor authored the 8-1 majority opinion of the Court.\u00a0The Confrontation Clause of the U.S. Constitution guarantees criminal defendants the right to confront witnesses against them, and the Court has recognized no open-ended exceptions to this requirement\u2014only those exceptions established at the time of the founding. In People v. Reid, New York\u2019s highest court held that a criminal defendant \u201copens the door\u201d to evidence that would otherwise be inadmissible under the Confrontation Clause if the evidence was \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to correct a misleading impression made by the defense\u2019s argument. Contrary to the State\u2019s contention, the Reid rule is not merely procedural, but a substantive principle of evidence that dictates what material is relevant and admissible. Such an exception is antithetical to the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p>Justice Samuel Alito authored a concurring opinion, in which Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined, to note different circumstances under which a defendant can be deemed to have waived the right to confront adverse witnesses.</p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, arguing that because Hemphill did not raise his Sixth Amendment claim in the New York Court of Appeals, the Court lacks jurisdiction to review its decision.</p>\n",
