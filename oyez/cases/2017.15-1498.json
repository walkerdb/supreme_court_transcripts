In 2007 and 2009, Dimaya was convicted under the California Penal Code for first-degree residential burglary; both convictions resulted in two years\u2019 imprisonment. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a non-citizen convicted of an aggravated felony is subject to deportation. The INA definition of aggravated felony includes a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d which is any offense that involves the use or substantial risk of physical force against another person or property.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) subsequently initiated deportation proceedings against Dimaya and claimed that his burglary convictions constituted crimes of violence under the Act. The Immigration Judge held that Dimaya was deportable and that burglary constitutes a crime of violence because it always involves a risk of physical violence. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed.</p>\n<p>While Dimaya\u2019s appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was pending, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Johnson v. United States, which held \u00a0that the definition of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d in the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) was unconstitutionally vague. As a result, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the INA\u2019s crime of violence provision was unconstitutionally vague because it was largely similar to the violent felony provision in the ACCA that the Supreme Court struck down in Johnson. The appellate court found that both provisions denied fair notice to defendants and failed to make clear when a risk of violence could be considered substantial.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Is the Immigration and Nationality Act\u2019s \u201ccrime of violence\u201d provision unconstitutionally vague under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>The Immigration and Nationality Act\u2019s \u201ccrime of violence\u201d provision is unconstitutionally vague, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Justice Elena Kagan delivered the 5-4 opinion as to parts .\u00a0To determine whether a person\u2019s conduct falls within a \"crime of violence\" under Section 16(b), courts consider the overall nature of the offense, particularly \u201cwhether \u2018the ordinary case\u2019 of an offense poses the requisite risk.\u201d The Court found that the term \u201cordinary case\u201d under the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d was too vague in that it risked unpredictable and arbitrary interpretation. In 2015, the Court struck down as unconstitutionally vague a similar provision of a different statute, see <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2014/13-7120\"><em>Johnson v. United States</em>, 576 U.S. ___ (2015)</a>, and this provision suffers from the same problems as the one in that case.</p>\n<p>A plurality of the court (the majority minus Justice Neil Gorsuch) rejected the government\u2019s argument removal cases deserved a less rigid form of the void-for-vagueness doctrine, largely because the penalty of deportation is so severe. Justice Gorsuch wrote a separate opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which he opined that even civil statutes that do not involve removal should be subject to a stringent void-for-vagueness review.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice John Roberts, joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito, dissented. Chief Justice Roberts argued that unlike the provision of a criminal statute that the Court struck down as overly vague in <em>Johnson</em>, the provision of the INA does not present the same kind of uncertainty that was present in that case.</p>\n<p>Justice Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, joined in part by Justices Kennedy and Alito,\u00a0to express \"doubt that our practice of striking down statutes as unconstitutionally vague is consistent with the original meaning of the Due Process Clause.\"</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 22617, "name": "Edwin S.
