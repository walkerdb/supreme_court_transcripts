We just compare what the agency believes qualifies as a firearm with what we think qualifies as a firearm, and if the agency has something in its definition that we wouldn't have put there, we say the agency has exceeded its authority?  I think those seem not right to me as the way of figuring out the question of exceeding the authority, and I think it can't be assumed that the agency exceeds its authority whenever it interprets a statutory term differently than we would such that all we have to do as a part of this claim here today is just decide what we think a firearm is."
