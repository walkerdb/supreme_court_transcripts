At the time of his sentencing, the Sentencing Guidelines range was 135\u2013168 months. The government recommended the minimum 135-month sentence, and the sentencing court accepted that recommendation. In 2014, the Sentencing Commission amended the Guidelines to reduce the relevant offense levels. Chavez-Meza subsequently sought and was granted a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He requested that the court reduce his sentence to 108 months, the new minimum, but the court reduced his sentence to 114 months. In issuing the new sentence, the court issued a standard form stating it had \u201ctak[en] into account the policy statement set forth at USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d Chavez-Meza appealed the reduced sentence, claiming that the district court did not adequately explain how it applied the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in deciding on the 114-month sentence. The Tenth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p>There is a circuit split as to whether a district court must explain how it applies the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have held that the district court must provide some explanation for its decision when the reasons are not otherwise apparent from the record. The Fourth, Fifth, and Tenth Circuits have held that the form language is sufficient.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Must a district court provide some explanation for its decision not to grant a proportional sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), as the 6th, 8th, 9th, and 11th Circuits have held, or is boilerplate language stating the court took into account the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors sufficient, as the 4th, 5th, and 10th Circuits have held?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>The Court affirmed, holding that because the record in this case as a whole demonstrated that the judge had a reasoned basis for his decision, the judge\u2019s explanation for reducing Chavez-Meza\u2019s sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to the middle instead of the bottom of the amended Federal Guidelines range was adequate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In a 5-3 opinion authored by Justice Breyer, the Court stated that even if a judge reducing a prisoner\u2019s sentence were subject to the same requirements as the original sentencing judge, the district court\u2019s explanation was appropriate in this case. The Court pointed out that the judge making the sentence modification, who was in fact the same judge who imposed the original sentence, had access to all of the factors considered at the original sentencing. He also certified that he had considered the relevant factors under \u00a7 3553(a), and then lowered Chavez-Meza\u2019s sentence to a point somewhat higher than the bottom of the new sentencing range. The Court found this unsurprising in light of the judge\u2019s conclusion that the original sentence of 135 months was sufficiently high. The Court stated that there may be cases in which a disproportionate sentence reduction may require a more detailed explanation. But here, given the simplicity of the case, as well as the judge\u2019s familiarity with the case history and the relevant sentencing factors, his explanation fell within the scope of discretion available to him under the law as a sentencing judge.</p>\n<p>Justice Kennedy authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Sotomayor and Kagan joined.</p>\n<p>Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 62980, "name": "Todd A.
