But there was no indication in that decision that any of those choices made by the hospital were backed by some sort of  -- of animus on behalf  -- you know, animus discriminating against individuals with disabilities.

And I think there also might have been a little bit of a misunderstanding about some of the daylight between these type of claims. I mean, my friend laid out very well, I think, that --  different protections under the IDEA and Title II and Section 504, but there are some claims you just can't bring under the IDEA.
