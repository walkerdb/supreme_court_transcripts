  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Willie Earl Carr sought disability benefits from the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d), but an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denied his claim and the agency\u2019s Appeals Council declined to review the decision. Carr appealed to a federal district court.</p>\n<p>While his case in the district court was pending, the U.S. Supreme Court held, in Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission, that Securities and Exchange Commission ALJs are \u201cinferior officers\u201d under the Appointments Clause of Article II of the U.S. Constitution, and as inferior officers, they must be appointed by the President, a court, or the head of the agency.</p>\n<p>In response to Lucia, the SSA Commissioner appointed the SSA\u2019s ALJs. After these appointment actions, Carr raised a claim for the first time that the ALJs who had rejected their claims had not been properly appointed under the Appointments Clause.</p>\n<p>The district court agreed, vacating the SSA\u2019s decision and remanding the case for new hearings before constitutionally appointed ALJs. By agreeing on the merits, the district court held that Carr had not waived his right to raise an Appointments Clause claim by failing to raise that claim during the administrative proceedings. The SSA Commissioner appealed, arguing that Carr did waive the Appointments Clause challenge by failing to raise it earlier. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit agreed and reversed the lower court.</p>\n",
