  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Reagan National Advertising of Austin and Lamar Advantage Outdoor Company own and operate signs and billboards that display commercial and non-commercial messages. They filed applications with the City of Austin to digitize existing billboards, but the City denied the applications because its sign code does not allow the digitization of off-premises signs.</p>\n<p>Reagan and Lamar sued, arguing that the code\u2019s distinction between on-premise signs and off-premise signs violates the First Amendment. The district court held that the sign code was content-neutral and thus that it need only satisfy intermediate scrutiny\u2014it must further an important government interest through means that are substantially related to that interest. The court found the code satisfied this test and entered judgment for the City. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, finding the code\u2019s distinction is content-based, therefore subject to scrutiny, and that it cannot withstand strict scrutiny.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Does the Austin city code\u2019s distinction between on-premise signs, which may be digitized, and off-premise signs, which may not, constitute facially unconstitutional content-based regulation?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>The City of Austin\u2019s on-/off-premises distinction is facially content-neutral under the First Amendment. Justice Sonia Sotomayor authored the majority opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>When the government regulates speech based on its content, the regulation is subject to strict scrutiny, which requires that the government show the regulation is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest. A regulation of speech is content based if it \u201capplies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.\u201d The City\u2019s off-premises distinction is agnostic as to content. It does not single out any topic or subject matter for differential treatment, and its focus on location is akin to ordinary time, place, or manner restrictions, which are also not subject to strict scrutiny. Thus, it is facially content neutral.</p>\n<p>Justice Stephen Breyer authored a concurrring opinion arguing that while Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155 (2015) is binding precedent that determines the outcome in this case (as the majority acknowledges), he disagrees with the Court\u2019s reasoning in that decision.</p>\n<p>Justice Samuel Alito authored an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part. He would reverse the lower court\u2019s holding that the signs are facially unconstitutional but disagrees with the majority that the provisions defining on- and off- premises signs do not discriminate on the basis of content, at least as applied in some situations.</p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett joined, arguing that the majority misinterprets Reed\u2019s rule for content-based restrictions and replaces it with \u201can incoherent and malleable standard.\u201d</p>\n",
