                "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Delaware law provides that no medical malpractice complaint may even be docketed unless it is accompanied by an expert affidavit.  That requirement conflicts with more  than a half dozen Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It conflicts with Rules 8 and 9, which set forth what a plaintiff must do to state a claim in federal court, and it conflicts with Rule 11, which bars verification and affidavit requirements unless a federal rule or statute provides otherwise.  Given its unavoidable conflicts with multiple federal rules, Delaware's law cannot apply in federal court.  Seeing that these conflicts are insurmountable, Respondents seek refuge in Rule 11(a), which says a pleading need not be verified or accompanied by an affidavit \"unless a rule or statute specifically states otherwise. \"  They say \"statute\" in that proviso means state statute.  But context matters, and Respondents ignored it.  A mountain of context  confirms that the word \"statute\" in Rule 11(a) refers to federal laws, not state laws.  The rule's text, context, history, and purpose make  Respondents' Rule 11(a) argument impossible.  Rule 11 was meant to abolish, not preserve, a patchwork of state affidavit rules like Delaware's.  Under Respondents' reading, Rule 11 abolished nothing at all.  Respondents call Delaware's rule substantive, but Delaware's law is procedural from tip to tail.  It designates when a complaint can be docketed, what it must say, and when the defendant must file a responsive pleading.  It doesn't define malpractice or alter any substantive standard of care.  By its terms, it applies to all malpractice actions in Delaware regardless of the state whose law governs the claim.  And by its terms, it does not apply to malpractice actions brought under Delaware law in the courts of oth er states. This is a procedural law.  The federal rules form a comprehensive scheme for the fast, fair, efficient resolution of cases in federal courts.  Delaware's law cuts an ugly gash through that scheme.  It has no place in federal court.  I welcome the Court's questions."

The pro- -- the prothonotary is not to docket the complaint in Delaware court in  --unless it has an affidavit of merit.  But the prothonotary is not an expert in choice-of-law analysis and so is going to just have to look at the face of the complaint to determine whether or not it's a medical malpractice claim that requires the affidavit.

Because getting back to  Justice Barrett's question, I thought your sort of clearest, most narrow, direct conflict was with Rule 3, and I know that you mention it, but you really rely on 8 and 9 in ways that I don't know are necessary.  I thought the theory was that we have this Delaware law saying what is necessary to file or initiate a malpractice lawsuit as a matter of procedure.  You have to have this separate AOM.  Notably, it's not evidence.  It is just what is a necessary step to initiate this lawsuit.  And under federal law, no such thing is required.  The federal law says that the action commences by filing a complaint with the court.  So why isn't that just clear, narrow, direct?  It doesn't rely on any thoughts about factual versus legal.  In fact, this is a factual distinction that could support a conflict, could it not?"

In fact, it has to stay secret.  The defendants never get to see it, so they can't even use it tactically in the case, in which case how is it evidence?  It's just a procedural barrier.  You have to just give the papers to the judge and that's it, and then it's out of the case.  And if that's true, then we do think that that makes it basically functionally a pleading.  It's basically give us some secret allegations."

                "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Rather than identify one federal rule that applied here, in fact, collided with the Delaware statute, Petitioner identifies separate  --seven separate rules and manufactures conflicts with all of them.  All of those conflicts are entirely hypothetical.  The trial court did not hold and Respondents did not argue below that this case could not be commenced under Rule 3.  Respondents never challenged the pleadings under Rule 12 or otherwise. Respondents didn't argue the affidavit had to  be filed with the complaint under Rule 11 or disclosed in discovery under Rule 26.  What this Court held in Hanna is that trial courts in the federal system must enforce state laws using federal modes of enforcement even though the federal rules are not identical to state court procedures.  Here, the trial court held and Respondents argued only that the Delaware affidavit-of-merit requirement had to be satisfied to maintain a cause of action for medical negligence under Delaware law, and because Petitioner couldn't obtain that affidavit, this case had to be dismissed.  The only question in dispute under Hanna is whether the affidavit -of -merit requirement can be enforced in federal court at all.  It can.  It can be enforced through dismissal under Rule 41, as courts have held, or it can be enforced through early summary judgment, as both the Seventh Circuit and Third Circuit have held.  Petitioner takes the extreme position that a federal court must ignore the entirety of a state statute if any part of it might conflict with a federal rule in some case. This Court has rejected that approach, which is why Petitioner in  -- in the briefing effectively concedes that to prevail, he has to convince the Court to overrule at least three of its decisions:  Cohen, Woods, and Gasperini.  That intrusion on the jurisprudence of Hanna is both unnecessary and would interfere with federalism.  I welcome the Court's questions."

What we did do is we filed a motion for in camera review with the trial court, and then the case proceeded, the pleadings were closed, and the case, in fact, entered -- entered discovery.  There are two -- at least two ways you can raise an affidavit -of-merit requirement consistent with the federal rules.  As I said,  Rule 41(b), which allows for involuntary dismissals if a plaintiff cannot comply with the court order.  Here, the court did order Petitioner to comply with the affidavit-of-merit requirement. Or you can raise it through summary judgment.  So either of those approaches are  perfectly consistent with the federal rules and don't create  any conflicts."

And Petitioner  -- that's why Petitioner wants the Court to overrule Cohen, because it's a -- a significant barrier that he has to affirming application of Delaware's affidavit-of-merit requirement in federal court.  It's not part of the pleadings.  It doesn't constrain the evidence in the case. The Delaware Supreme Court has said that very clearly.  It's a separate requirement necessary to demonstrate that a plaintiff has done the appropriate consultation with a medical expert to  -- to say just what the statute says, which is that there's reasonable grounds to proceed.  Our only point, and I think the only question under Hanna, and this is very important, is that if those requirements can  be enforced in federal court using the federal rules without any conflict, there's no occasion for a federal court to disregard the retire -- the  -- the requirement in all cases for all time forever in federal court, which really is Petitioner's position.  In Hanna, the court  --the conflict, Justice Kavanaugh, was unavoidable.  That's  what the conflict has to be.  There, there was no way for the Court not to adjudicate the conflict because the trial court had dismissed the case due to the method of service the plaintiff had decided to use.  It was either apply the state rule of service or the federal rule.  There was no choice between the two.  Here, at no point did any party or the trial court attempt ever to do anything that created any kind of conflict with the federal rules, which is our point.  And if Cohen can allow states to regulate causes of action for shareholder derivative suits, which are wholly within the state power to regulate, Delaware ought to be able, like most states, regulate medical negligence claims, which the parties agree are entirely within the power of state legislatures to regulate."

And there is no dispute that if a plaintiff can't obtain  an affidavit, even after the 60 days after the fact, a case has to be dismissed.  We've cited some cases in the -- the briefing from the Delaware Supreme Court that apply this statute fairly flexibly, giving  plaintiffs more time even after the time has expired.  But the one thing they do say is that if you want to maintain the cause of action under state law, you have to obtain the affidavit.  And this really was part of the reasoning of the Seventh Circuit, and the Third Circuit has held the same thing.  The  -- the requirement to obtain the affidavit and the ability to enforce that requirement while the suit is pending and certainly before trial are the two key aspects.  Both of those aspects can be enforced  using existing federal rules without conflicting with any of them."

Second, to the extent there is a -- is a conflict with Rule 3, I think Walker -- this Court's decision in the Walker case, which is about commencing a case under Rule 3 and whether commencing a case under Rule 3 conflicted with a state requirement that said you have to commence a case for purposes of a state law cause of action through service.  And what the Court said is Rule 3 is the mechanism by which you start the federal case for federal deadlines, but it doesn't do away with other state law requirements that have to be satisfied in order for a particular plaintiff to maintain a cause of action.  So there's no conflict here.  Under the terms of the statute, you can get more time, so, clearly, you can commence a case without filing the affidavit."

Literally, the affidavit needs only say exactly what the statutory text or the functional equivalent says.  And that was the  Dishmon case from  --from Delaware Supreme Court in 2011.  So it's a prophylactic measure.  It  -- I do think it's similar to a bond requirement. Do this thing.  Satisfy this requirement.  If you can't do that, you -- you can't maintain the cause of action.  And that's all Delawa re is doing.  And other states have done it to good effect through their medical malpractice reform laws.  And as the American Hospital Association brief  explains, they have been very, very important in limiting frivolous medical negligence cases just like this one, which was filed by a pro se plaintiff who couldn't obtain that sort of basic prophylactic measure.  So, if Cohen can condition a shareholder derivative suit on obtaining a bond, it's really hard to understand why  Delaware can't regulate claims for medical malpractice by requiring an affidavit.  And if petitioners or if -- if defendants can bring those issues to the court using the federal rules without conflict, Hanna  says you have to enforce those requirements because the modes of enforcing them don't have to be the same, but the law has to be applied the same across the two judicial systems."

I think that much was true of the  -- the New York statute in Shady Grove, and -- and it's been true in -- in other cases too.  Semtek, which interpreted Rule 41, it said, well, we could apply this to preclude the state law of claim preclusion or we could apply  it to incorporate the state law of claim preclusion.  There, it wasn't an on/off switch, and it wasn't we can apply one or the other. The Court said no, no, we apply Rule 41, but we do so in a way that preserves the substantive state law of claim preclusion.  So that's the difference between sort of the Semtek example and the Shady Grove example where there's just no way to reconcile the two."

                "text": " Thank you, Your Honor. Just a few points.  I'll just start with Justice Gorsuch's point about whether this is privileged under state law.  It doesn't say the word \"privileged.\"  It only applies to discovery in medical negligence actions.  You -- the federal court would essentially have to procedurally freelance to sort of say, well, Delaware probably wants this to be privileged in order to actually make it  work within the federal procedural scheme.  So I just don't  --I -- this is news to me that it -- that it creates a privilege, and who  -- who even holds this privilege, the doctor or the -- the plaintiff?  It's unclear. We're not trying to overrule anything. We're the party here saying, apply Shad y Grove. Use the answers, the same question, framework, and reach the result that that inevitably requires, which is that this Delaware statute answers the same question as  --as many Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and to the extent that it does, it's in conflict.  Cohen didn't govern pleadings.  It was a case about whether or not you have to post bond.  The court in the case said things like, you know, it creates a new liability that didn't exist before.  That makes it, you know, manifestly substantive.  It has nothing to do with the merits of  --of your claim.  It's simply a security against losing the suit.  Walker is even further afield.  It's a case about whether a corporation that doesn't appoint a corporate agent in the state can maintain a suit in the state.  That just  -- or I'm sorry, not Walker.  That's Woods.  Walker is about Rule 3 and whether, for certain state statutes of limitation, the \"commence the action\" language of Rule 3 was intended to  -- to displace the state statute of limitations.  That just has nothing to do with  the nature of the Rule 3 conflict, for instance, in this case, which, literally, the Delaware statute changes when the answer is due.  I mean, this commence  --this is about \"commences the action.\"  Justice Kagan's point that you have to prove your case before it's even started, that is the fundamental thrust of this Delaware law and laws like this.  You need to come to court with evidence that  -- that was discovered outside the discovery process and you need not only to have it, but you need to submit it and you need to do it through a certain procedure.  And so, even if you thought consultation with an expert, which is how Respondents have framed it, might be permissible, you know, say in your complaint I consulted with an expert, but actually having  them then sign an affidavit and give it to the court is a whole different thing.  You know, these affidavits are extremely hard to procure.  You know, my  client's treating physician said that he had a good malpractice case and -- but wouldn't sign the affidavit because it's a big deal to sign these affidavits.  So they're -- they're more  than a barrier.  Even if you have a meritorious case, they can be a barrier that keeps you out.  In -- in terms of talking about, like, what could they require, how many affidavits could they require, what kinds of affidavits could they require, we sort of have been using the 12 nuns formulation, you know, like to bring a contract action, you have to have 12 nuns, you know, swear that this is a  -- that this really is the parol evidence that would support your contract claim.  Just, it would  -- it would allow states to smuggle in whatever procedural system they want through the back door of we're going to label it an affidavi t. So Shady Grove, as I read it, said, you know, the question is what claims can be maintained as a class action, so it  was all about, you know, could you add requirements to Rule 23, and the Court said no.  So, you know, I think that this case is -- is really quite on all fours with Shady Grove.  I just want to say the federal rules answer the same question the Delaware law answers, and they answer them differently. Under Hanna and Shady Grove, that's  dispositive.  We urge you to reverse."
