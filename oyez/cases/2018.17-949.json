  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>John Sturgeon wanted to use his hovercraft on the Nation River, which runs through Alaska\u2019s Yukon-Charley National Preserve conservation unit, designated as such by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101 et seq., to reach moose hunting grounds. The State of Alaska would permit him to do so, whereas the federal government would not pursuant to National Park Service regulations. Sturgeon argued that the Nation River belonged to Alaska, and that the National Park Service could not regulate or prohibit the use of hovercraft on that portion of the river. Sturgeon sought declaratory and injunctive relief barring the Park Service from enforcing its hovercraft ban. The district court and appellate court denied him relief, interpreting the statute as limiting the Park Service\u2019s authority to impose Alaska-specific regulations on inholdings but not its authority to enforce nationwide regulations like the hovercraft rule. The US Supreme Court rejected this interpretation and remanded the case for further consideration.</p>\n<p>On remand from the US Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the Nation River was public land for purposes of ANILCA and thus that it was subject to the regulatory authority of the National Park Service.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Is Alaska\u2019s Nation River public land and therefore subject to the regulatory authority of the National Park Service?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>The Nation River is not public land, so it is exempt under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) from the National Park Service\u2019s regulatory authority, as are all non-public lands and navigable waters within Alaska\u2019s national parks. In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Elena Kagan, the Court held that Alaska\u2019s Nation River is not a public land because the United States does not and cannot have \u201ctitle\u201d to the Nation River. Under 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 3103(c) (\u201cSection 103(c)\u201d) the Park Service may exercise its authority only on public lands, so non-public lands are outside its domain. Moreover, navigable waters within Alaska\u2019s national parks are also exempt from the Park Service\u2019s normal regulatory authority because ANILCA expressly defines \u201cland\u201d to mean \u201clands, waters, and interests therein.\u201d</p>\n<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined, emphasizing certain \u201cimportant regulatory pathways that the Court\u2019s decision leaves open for future exploration.\u201d Specifically, Justice Sotomayor points out that the Court\u2019s holding does not preclude the Park Service from exercising any regulatory authority over the Nation River, only that it may not regulate the Nation River as if it were within Alaska\u2019s federal park system.</p>\n",
