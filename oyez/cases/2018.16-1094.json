  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Sailors and spouses of sailors injured in the 2000 bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in the Port of Aden, Yemen filed suit in 2010 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1130, 1602, et seq., alleging that Sudan had provided material support to al Qaeda, whom they alleged was responsible for the attack. In accordance with the plaintiffs\u2019 request, the clerk of the court served the summons and complaint on Sudan by mailing the case documents to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sudan via the Sudanese Embassy in Washington, D.C., and received a return receipt. Sudan did not answer the complaint within the required time frame, and the clerk of the court therefore entered a default against Sudan. In 2012, the district court entered a default judgment against Sudan in the amount of approximately $314,000, and found that service had been proper. The clerk of the court mailed a copy of the default judgement to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sudan via the Sudanese Embassy in Washington, D.C., and received confirmation that it had been delivered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The judgment was registered in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which in late 2013 and early 2014 issued three turnover orders directing particular banks to turn over assets of Sudan to the plaintiffs. After the third turnover order was issued, Sudan filed a notice of appearance, and on the same day, appealed the turnover orders to the Second Circuit. The appeals court affirmed the orders, holding that service of process had been proper under FSIA. In 2015, Sudan sought a rehearing en banc, and the United States filed an amicus brief in support of the petition. The Second Circuit denied Sudan\u2019s request for a rehearing en banc.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Did the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit err by holding \u2013 in direct conflict with the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the District of Columbia, 5th and 7th Circuits and in the face of an amicus brief from the United States \u2013 that plaintiffs suing a foreign state under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act may serve the foreign state under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608(a)(3) by mail addressed and dispatched to the head of the foreign state's ministry of foreign affairs \u201cvia\u201d or in \u201ccare of\u201d the foreign state's diplomatic mission in the United States, despite U.S. obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to preserve mission inviolability?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>When civil process is served on a foreign state under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608(a)(3) requires a mailing to be sent directly to the foreign minister\u2019s office in the foreign state. In an 8\u20131 majority opinion authored by Justice Samuel Alito, the Court held that the most natural reading of \u00a7 1608(a)(3) required that the Republic of Sudan be served by a mailing sent directly to its foreign minister\u2019s office in Sudan, not to the Sudanese Embassy in the United States.</p>\n<p>A federal court may exercise jurisdiction over a foreign state in limited circumstances as described in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA). Relevant in this case is that a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign state only \u201cwhere service has been made under section 1608.\u201d That section, specifically \u00a7 1608(a)(3), allows for four methods of serving civil process, one of which\u2014at issue in this case\u2014is service \u201cby any form of mail requiring a signed receipt, to be addressed and dispatched . . . to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of the foreign state concerned.\u201d The Court found that \u201caddressed\u201d means having one\u2019s name and address placed on the outside of a letter or package, and that an \u201caddress\u201d means \u201ca residence or place of business.\u201d The foreign nation\u2019s embassy in the United States is neither \u201ca residence\u201d nor its \u201cplace of business.\u201d Moreover, to \u201cdispatch\u201d means to \u201csend directly\u201d to the address of the intended recipient.</p>\n<p>The Court then found that its interpretation of the meaning of the statute bolstered by other related provisions. The \u201caddressed and dispatched\u201d language is intended to be \u201creasonably calculated to give actual notice\u201d to the recipient.</p>\n<p>Further, the Court found that its interpretation leads to other logical results. If mailing a service packet to a foreign state\u2019s embassy in the United States were sufficient, then it would be easier to serve the foreign state itself than to serve a person in that foreign state under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which is an illogical result.</p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas authored a dissenting opinion arguing that FSIA \u201cneither specifies nor precludes the use of any particular address\u201d and that, given \u201cthe unique role that embassies play in facilitating communications between states,\u201d service by mailing to Sudan\u2019s embassy in Washington, D.C., should comply with the requirements of FSIA.</p>\n",
