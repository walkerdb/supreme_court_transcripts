  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Patrick Dwayne Murphy, a member of the Creek Nation, was convicted in Oklahoma state court and sentenced to death for the 1999 murder of George Jacobs, who was a member of the same nation. Murphy\u2019s conviction and death sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. Murphy then sought post-conviction relief on jurisdictional grounds, arguing that the Major Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a), gave the federal government exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute murders committed by Indians in Indian Country, a term defined under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151 to include reservations, allotments, and dependent Indian communities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA) ultimately rejected Murphy\u2019s jurisdictional argument, ruling that the state\u2019s jurisdiction was proper because the land where the crime occurred was not an allotment, and because Murphy had offered insufficient evidence that the land was part of a reservation or dependent Indian community. The OCCA acknowledged authority from the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals stating that the Creek Reservation still existed but reserving the matter of whether its 1866 boundaries remained intact, and declined to make a finding on the boundary question if the federal courts had not done so.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Murphy then sought habeas relief in federal district court, challenging Oklahoma\u2019s jurisdiction on the theory that the crime had occurred in Indian Country because the land at issue was part of the Creek Reservation under \u00a7 1151(a), and because the land was an Indian allotment under \u00a7 1151(c). The district court rejected his claims, and Murphy appealed to the 10th Circuit.</p>\n<p>The federal appeals court reversed, ruling that the crime occurred on the Creek Reservation, and that the Oklahoma state courts lacked jurisdiction. As an initial matter, the court found that under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, the OCCA\u2019s decisions in Murphy\u2019s case were contrary to clearly established law, which was provided by <em>Solem v. Bartlett</em>, 465 U.S. 463 (1984). Next, applying <em>Solem</em>\u2019s three-part test, the court concluded that Congress had not disestablished the Creek Reservation. The crime had therefore occurred in Indian country under \u00a7 1151(a), meaning that the federal government had exclusive jurisdiction and Oklahoma lacked jurisdiction under \u00a7 1153(a). The court remanded the case with instructions to grant Murphy\u2019s application for habeas relief under \u00a7 2254.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Do the 1866 territorial boundaries of the Creek Nation within the former Indian Territory of eastern Oklahoma constitute an \u201cIndian reservation\u201d today under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151(a)?</p>\n",
