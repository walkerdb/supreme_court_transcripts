                "text": " Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  On April 2, President Trump determined that our exploding trade deficits had brought us to the brink of an economic and national security catastrophe.  He further pronounced  that the traffic of fentanyl and other opioids into our country has created a public health crisis, taking hundreds of thousands of American lives.  President Trump has declared that these emergencies are country-killing and not sustainable, that they threaten the bedrock of our national and economic security, and that fixing them will make America strong,  financially viable, and a respected country again.  Due to IEEPA tariffs, President Trump has negotiated agreements worth trillions of  dollars with major trading partners, including most recently China.  Unwinding those agreements, he warns, would expose us to ruthless trade retaliation by far more aggressive countries and drive America from strength to failure, with ruinous economic and  national security consequences.  In Dames & Moore against Regan, this Court held that IEEPA's sweeping and  unqualified language grants the President's actions the strongest presumption of validity and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation.  Yet plaintiffs argue that  tariffs, IEEPA's least blunt and most nimble tool, are virtually the only tool that Congress did not grant the President to deal with foreign emergencies.  That is wrong.  The phrase \"regulate importation\" plainly embraces tariffs, which  are among the most traditional and direct methods of regulating importation.  And plaintiffs concede that IEEPA authorizes quotas and other tariff equivalents.  The major questions doctrine does not apply here.  IEEPA confers major powers to  address major problems on the President, who is perhaps the most major actor in the realm of foreign affairs.  And the nondelegation doctrine casts no doubt on IEEPA because  Congress may assign the President broad authority regarding the conduct of foreign affairs, where he enjoys his own inherent Article II powers.  I welcome the Court's questions."

First of all, though the major questions doctrine may apply to the President in other contexts, specifically in the foreign affairs context, where he has his own inherent Article II authority, it's a particularly poor  fit to apply the major questions doctrine, and that's for at least two reasons.  First of all, just as a matter of kind of common-sense interpretation, one would expect Congress to confer major powers on the  President to address major, you know, sort of foreign  --international crises, so to speak, in foreign-arising emergencies, that that's just sort of a natural, common -sense thing you expect Congress to do.  And, in fact, you know, Justice Jackson in his Youngstown opinion addressed  this very situation at pages 652 and 653 when he says this is the system within our -- or this is the procedure within our constitutional system that we have developed to strike the  balance, you know, what Dames & Moore described as the never-ending tension between the need for the executive to address -- have robust powers to address emergencies and to subject it to checks and balances.  What our constitutional system has devised to address that particular problem, that never-ending tension, is the system where Congress confers broad and necessary powers in advance and subjects them to ongoing political oversight, which is exactly what you see in IEEPA.  So that's one reason, one reason just as a matter of common-sense interpretation you would expect Congress to grant major powers to the President, who has his own broad range of major authority, Article  --inherent Article II authority in this context.  And that is by just my second point, which is  --"

That's a generally accepted view that the President has broad authority in the foreign affairs realm.  Now there's been debates about exactly how far it goes and how to draw the boundary between the President and Congress, but Egan, Garamendi, other cases, Curtiss-Wright, the Court has recognized the President has broad inherent authority to address foreign  situations, foreign affairs, foreign policy, including foreign-arising emergencies. Now we don't contend that he has  --he has at least in peacetime inherent tariffing authority.  What we have here is two layers.  There's the layer, the bedrock, of the President's, you know, inherent Article II powers, and layered on top of that is a sweeping delegation of -- of authority from Congress.  When you put those two things  together, Congress has said you have inherent powers to address international emergencies, and we're conferring you -- on you the tools, including Article I tools, like, for example, the power to regulate foreign commerce.  And I want to make a very important distinction here.  We don't contend that what's being exercised here is the power to tax.  It's the power to regulate foreign commerce.  These are regulatory tariffs.  They are not revenue-raising tariffs.  The fact that they raise revenue is only incidental.  The tariffs  would be most effective, so to speak, if no -- no  --no person ever paid them.  They  --they achieve their goals if they -- and so forth."

It said:  \"Decisions in this area have been rare, episodic, and afford little  precedential value for subsequent cases.\" Again:  \"We lay down no general guidelines covering other situations not involved here and  confine the opinion only to the very questions necessary to a decision of this case.\"  And, at the end of the opinion, it said:  \"Finally, we re-emphasize the narrowness of our decision.\" Now this  --at issue in Dames & Moore was a different provision of IEEPA, not at issue here, and certainly did not concern  tariffs.

And I guess I'm wondering whether you also don't have to contend with the actual purpose of IEEPA in making this argument because, as I understand it, that the -- IEEPA was designed and intended to limit presidential authority, that Congress was concerned about how presidents had been using the authority under the predecessor statute, TWEA, and it's  pretty clear that Congress was trying to constrain the emergency powers of the President in IEEPA.  So it seems a little inconsistent to say that we have to interpret a statute that was designed to constrain presidential authority consistent with an understanding that Congress wanted the President to have essentially unlimited authority."

So the tariff there was used as here, in part as leverage to get our trading partners to the negotiating table, and it was  subsequently upheld by the Federal Circuit, the CCPA, the Federal Circuit's predecessor that had exclusive jurisdiction over that question, to include the power to tariff.  And then, two  years later, Congress took that same phrase and re-enacted it in IEEPA after carefully studying the problem of presidential emergency powers and being deeply concerned about, you know, excessive or abusive exercise of that power.  So that whole -- that whole sort of process gives sort of strong sort of confirmation that this phrase \"regulate importation\" carries with it the power to tariff.  Now, of course, that's not our leading argument.  Our lead argument on interpretation is there's a  -- a --a pedigree, historical pedigree, of regulating imports specifically where the power to tariff is just the  --sort of a core application of that, a quintessential exercise of that power.

If you had asked the founders how do you regulate imports, they would say, of course, we tariff.  That's  what we do.  So it would be very unusual to say we're giving you the power to regulate importation to -- and say but you cannot impose regulatory tariffs.  That would be almost a -- a contradiction.  And all the historical sources we cite in our brief, you know, relate to that particular historical pedigree.  And, as I was referring to earlier, there's a specific pedigree of \"regulate importation\" here in the specific context of the Presidents Polk and Lincoln and President McKinley asserting the authority to impose tariffs in wartime that was then codified in TWEA and then recodified for peacetime in TWEA in 1933 and then carried over into IEEPA.  So there's that as well.  But, more importantly, if you look at the sort of triggering conditions that members of this Court have identified for the major questions doctrine, there's a series of them and we think they really do -- all of them don't apply here.  For example, the notion that  the power is unheralded.  You refer to the fact  that IEEPA's never been asserted to invoke tariffs.  But, of course, the immediately predecessor statute that  --that -- the tariffs that President Nixon imposed on that were upheld under this very language.  So this -- I would say this is  -- and it was recodified in IEEPA two years later.  So this is kind of the opposite of unheralded power.  It's also heralded because there's this longstanding delegation  -- tradition  of very broad delegations of the foreign commerce power going back to the founding, going back to 1790  --"

First of all, this Court has stated that the nondelegation doctrine does not apply with anything like the same force in -- in --as it does in the domestic context in the foreign context.  And that again, to cite Dames  Moore again, Dames  Moore cites Youngstown.  In  Youngstown in Footnote 2 of Justice Jackson's opinion, he goes into detail about this.  He  addresses Curtiss-Wright.  He says there's a lot of broad dicta in Curtiss-Wright.  But the holding of Curtiss-Wright, the ratio decidendi, is that the non -- the domestic nondelegation doctrine does not apply with the same force in the  -- in the foreign context.  And then he -- and he used that phrase, \"does not apply.\"  He says the strict limitations on delegation that apply, you know, in the internal context does  --do not apply in the external context. And so we rely on that line of cases and for the reason I talked about earlier, where we talk about a situation where the President has his own inherent authority to address foreign -arising emergencies and Congress is conferring tools on him that expand his ability, his capacity to do so, we are in the area of Youngstown Zone 1."

                "text": " Yes, Justice Thomas. And turning back to the response I was giving to Justice Barrett earlier, there is -- I think it's very well set out in Professor Bamzai's amicus brief.  There is this history of presidents using a tariffing power or a tariff -equivalent power, very, very close to tariffing power, in wartime to tariff trading with enemies.  And that  -- when the Trading with the Enemy Act was enacted in 1917, it was deliberately evoking that, and when it brings in the power to regulate importation, it's essentially codifying for -- an inherent power  the President's already recognized to have. And then, in 1933, when that power was expanded to an area where he wouldn't inherently have it, the peacetime context, that  codification, the meaning of that remains the same.  The \"regulate importation\" language  that's brought in from TWEA and then ultimately to IEEPA in 1977 is carrying with it that connotation.  And that's reinforced by all the  cases we've cited in our brief where there's been extremely broad delegations of the power  to tariff specifically and the power to regulate foreign commerce more generally, going back to the time of the founding, which ties to your question about nondelegation."

And I think the significance of Yoshida is at a higher level.  Keep in mind that their principal position is no tariffs at all.  \"Regulate importation\" just doesn't carry  a connotation of the power to tariff.  And we say we've got historical sources going back to Gibbons against Ogden that say the opposite.  But, more fundamentally, everyone knew that at the time IEEPA was enacted that it regulated importation.  It just very visibly and very prominently had been upheld to include a very  --a sweeping global tariff."

By  --\"The President may under such regulations as he may prescribe by means of instructions, licenses, or otherwise\" then do what the verbs permit him to do.  By license, he can nullify, void,  prevent, or prohibit any acquisition, et cetera.  So \"license\" is not being used as a verb, that through licensing he can raise revenue.  He can only use licenses to accomplish the verbs.  So I don't understand  how we can treat licensing as equivalent to revenue-raising as used in IEEPA.  The license is only to accomplish what (b) permits."

And so that  -- if -- if -- if one does not think that with respect to tariffs, if one thinks that a tariff is a -- is a taxing power, is a regulation of foreign commerce that is really delegated by the Constitution to Congress, that argument does not -- does not sound so well. And, in fact, when you look at J.W. Hampton, which gives rise to the nondelegation  test that we usually use, J.W. Hampton is a tariffs case, and the Court did not say, oh, we need some special new principle here, some stricter rule, because we're dealing with tariffs in which presidents are directly concerned as a matter of foreign relations.  It enunciated the test we use for all  nondelegations.  So how does that fit with your theory?"

Chicago and Southern Air Lines and other cases of the 1930s.  Shortly after, J.W. Hampton  talked about the very large delegations of the foreign commerce power being very effective.  And, of course, this goes back to the very dawn of the Republic.  In 1790, for example, Congress conferred on President Washington basically the entire Indian commerce power.  He said go, you know, get licenses,  right, to do commerce with the Indians, and they'll be subject to whatever rules and regulations President Washington can make.  So I do think there is a profound consistency between the announcement of the intelligible principle test in J.W. Hampton and then the subsequent recognition by this Court in Curtiss-Wright that the nondelegation doctrine doesn't apply --"

This is IEEPA, a  statute that Congress carefully crafted to grant the President admittedly broad powers to address foreign -arising emergencies.  It's outward-facing to foreign affairs, where there's the broadest level of deference to the political branches that this Court has recognized in many cases.  And it imposed not a floor or a limit on the amount of the tariffs that could be imposed, very naturally because, for example, as this Court said in Loving, quoting, you  know, Alexander Hamilton and Federalist Number  23, it's impossible to foresee either what exigencies may arise or what tools may be  needed to address those exigencies, the means that may be required to address those exigencies.  Instead, Congress granted very broad powers, but they're confined to a particular domain.  This domain is any property  in which any foreign government or any national thereof has any interest.  So the -- the sort of discipline if one were to apply -- we say you shouldn't -- but, if you were to apply the -- the nondelegation doctrine, the domestic-facing nondelegation doctrine in this context, there is a significant limitation there --"

But the point I would make in response to that is those are  --even if there's limited judicial review, which is very natural in the foreign affairs context, this Court has always -- always granted the President the -- the presumption that he's acting in good faith. There are real hurdles.  They are very significant.  It's got to be an unusual, extraordinary threat that arises in whole or  substantial part outside the United States, so it's entirely foreign-facing, to the national security, economy, or, you know, foreign policy of the United States.  So there  --there are those.  Then there's, you know, 1701(b), which talks about how it can be used for this and -- and for no other purpose.  Then there are limitations in Section 1702(b).  Then there is the limitations I referred to earlier about what he can actually do.  He can do a heck of a  lot but only when he's dealing with property in which foreigners have an interest, and that's a pretty narrow domain.  That's -- that's quite a silo, so to speak.  And, then, of course, overarching it all, there is congressional oversight.  And you  may say congressional oversight may not have much bite, but Congress didn't think so. Congress crafted this compromise.  It balanced the never-ending tension. When it  -- when it drafted IEEPA, it had its eyes open, as -- as the dissent below says, its eyes open looking at the problem of sweeping emergency powers for an executive who may use them in a way that's excessive versus  the need to address unforeseeable emergencies."

Those are situations -- for example, Loving against United States, the President had broad Article II inherent authority.  There was the commander-in-chief power.  But this Court held he does not have inherent authority to do the power that was delegated to him, right, which was the power to, you know, identify aggravators that make you eligible for the death penalty in court -martial trials. And yet this Court said, well, we're not going to see a delegation problem here, even though it's really a wholesale delegation, which would otherwise be legislative authority.  It would be kind of like a small version of what your hypothetical would be, an abdication.  But, because you're in a foreign affairs context or there commander-in-chief, a military context, where the President has his  own delegation of authority, he doesn't have the power to do this, but, because of his background inherent authority, the Court said this is a situation where we're not going to see a delegation problem when there clearly would have been a delegation problem in the domestic context.

Okay.  One problem you have is that presidents since IEEPA have not done this.  Your primary answer or one of your many answers to that is the Nixon example, and that's a good example for you because Nixon relied on \"regulate importation\" to impose a worldwide tariff.  Good example.  What is our understanding of Congress in 1977 vis --vis that Nixon example when Congress re -enacts or enacts the \"regulate importation\" language into IEEPA?"

So it would be textually astonishing given that historical pedigree going back to  Gibbons, going back to, you know, Madison's letter to Cabell, and all the historical  sources cited in our briefs, it would be kind of astonishing to say, hey, President, you can  regulate imports, but -- we're not saying this  explicitly, but you do not have the power to tariff when the  -- the tariffing is the -- in many ways, the quintessential way of regulating importation.  So -- so that historical  pedigree, you know, sort of gives freighted meaning to that two-word phrase."

So I do think there are some distinctions, but keeping that in mind, if you say that there really is, as a practical  matter, no difference, this is kind of what I'm hung up on in \"license\" that maybe you can help.  So, in IEEPA, Justice Sotomayor is right, \"license\" is used as a noun, but it's one of the means necessary.  So, in Algonquin, it was \"by any means necessary adjust.\"  Here,  the statute says the President may under such regulations as he may prescribe by means of instructions, licenses, or otherwise regulate importation, which is the key part for our  purposes.  So the means it specifies are instructions, licenses, or otherwise.  So I think it would -- I --I mean, one argument might be that it would have been natural for Congress to put the President may by means of instructions, licenses, tariffs, or otherwise, with an ejusdem generis thing, I think you have to rely on the \"or otherwise\" picking up more,  or, if there really is no practical difference between licenses and tariffs, why aren't you making the argument or why didn't the President structure this as a licensing fee scheme?

Executive Order 14257 spells out the nature of the emergency and basically says that there's this -- this sort of lack of reciprocity, this asymmetric treatment, you know, our trade with respect to foreign countries, trade that does run across the board is a global problem.  I think that puts in context the argument they make that this power to tariff is so broad because you're applying it to every country in the world.  That conflates the  nature of the tool, tariffing, which they're challenging here, with the nature of the declared emergency, which they haven't disputed.  They haven't disputed, for example, that the President has correctly identified that virtually every major trading partner has  this longstanding sort of asymmetric unfair treatment of  -- of our trade. So the argument this power is so broad, this power is so broad is really based on a conflation of two different things.  One is the power, right?  Imagine this.  Imagine  that, for example, President Reagan had wanted to convince South Africa to change its apartheid policies and he imposed tariffs on them. No one would bat an eyelash and say, well, that's too broad, that's too broad, that can't be in IEEPA.  The power to tariff is a  -- sort of fits naturally with all those powers to block, prohibit, and seize and so forth.  What they're saying, and this so broad, because the emergency is so broad, but, of course, that's a presidential determination that  --and -- and there's all kinds of basis for it.  And also keep in mind that the emergency is not like just the asymmetric treatment.  It's the impact of the asymmetric, the underlying conditions, the hollowing out of our manufacturing base, you -- you -- you know, the  -- the -- the vulnerability of our supply chains, and, of course, the  -- the --our defense and industrial base's vulnerability of key inputs."

But I guess I'm trying to understand then your argument from the text of the actual statute because the statute, unlike what you suggested to Justice Kagan, is focused on the actual actions that the President can take.  In  response to Justice Kagan, I understood you to say that Congress was giving the President broad authority to act and it was within a particular domain, which is the domain of  emergencies with respect to foreign power, but the President could basically do a lot of things.  But, when I read the statute, it is telling the President exactly what he can do, investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, regulate, direct, and compel, nullify, void, prevent, or prohibit.  And I guess what is a little concerning to me is that your argument suggests  that we should see the word \"impose\" -- the phrase \"impose tariffs\" in that same series of things that the President could do.  We don't see that word, and, instead, you take \"regulate\" and say that must mean that.  So I guess I'm getting back to Justice Barrett's maybe original question, which was where else in the Code has Congress used the word \"regulate\" to sub in for \"impose tariffs\"?"

                "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Tariffs are taxes.  They take dollars from Americans' pockets and deposit them in the U.S.  Treasury.  Our founders gave that taxing power to Congress alone.  Yet, here, the  President bypassed Congress and imposed one of the largest tax increases in our lifetimes.  Many doctrines explain why this is illegal, like the presumption that Congress speaks clearly when it imposes taxes and duties and the major questions doctrine.  But it comes down to common sense. It's simply implausible that in enacting IEEPA Congress handed the President the power to  overhaul the entire tariff system and the American economy in the process, allowing him to set and reset tariffs on any and every product from any and every country at any and all times.  And, as Justices Gorsuch and Barrett just said, this is a one-way ratchet.  We will never get this power back if the government wins this case.  What president wouldn't veto  legislation to rein this power in and pull out the tariff power?  IEEPA is a sanction statute.  It's not a tax statute where Congress gave away the store.  Congress knows exactly how to delegate its tariff powers.  Every time for 238 years,  it's done so explicitly, always with real limits.  IEEPA looks nothing like those laws. It uses \"regulate,\" which Congress has used hundreds of times, never once to include tariffs.  And it lacks the limits of every other tariff statute.  And that is why, even  though presidents have used IEEPA to impose economic sanctions thousands of times, no president in IEEPA's 50-year lifetime has ever tried to impose tariffs.  And the President bypassed statutes that do address tariffs, like Section 122 for large and serious trade deficits, but that imposes a clear guardrail, 15 percent cap,  150-day limit. This is Youngstown at its lowest ebb. If the government wins, another president could declare a climate emergency and impose huge tariffs without fines or  --without floors or ceilings, as Justice Gorsuch said.  My friend's answer?  This administration would declare it a hoax.  The next president may not quite say that.  This is an open -ended power to junk the tariff laws and is certainly not conveyed by the  -- by the word \"regulate.\" I welcome the Court's questions."

                "text": " So -- and this is the argument in the  --in the fine dissent below. And I think there are three answers to that, Justice Thomas.  The first is revenue-raising. Embargoes stop the shipment.  Tariffs start the tax bill.  They are first and foremost ways of  regulating revenue, as some of your own opinions said.  This is the way we actually chiefly got revenue for the first hundred years of our republic.  Tariffs are constitutionally  special because our founders feared revenue-raising, unlike embargoes.  You know, there was no Boston embargo party, but there was certainly a Boston tea party.  The second thing, textually, in the statute, it's different.  \"Regulate\" appears in  a cluster of verbs, as was said before, \"investigate,\" \"block,\" \"nullify,\" and the like.  They describe embargo-like controls, \"prevent\" and \"prohibit,\" for example.  But they don't describe revenue exactions.  That's Justice Kagan's point.  The one verb that's missing here is anything about raising revenue whatsoever.  Another point, congressional displacement.  Today, there's a whole host of statutes in the tariff architecture of Title 19 which both expressly confer the power to tariff and always impose clear limits.  Embargoes by the President  --embargoes don't have any of that.  They don't set aside that whole thing.  If you look at the Learning Resources brief at page 5, it goes through these statutes in detail.  Section 122 expressly says \"duties\"  and then limits it, 15 percent, 150 days. Section 201, any duty on the imported article, but it requires ITC findings.  Section 301, impose duties.  That's the language of the  statute, but all sorts of procedural restrictions.  Section 338, the same.  I can go through this and I could start, by the way, Justice Thomas, with the statutes at the founding, all of which expressly said the word \"tariff\" or an equivalent."

But what did Congress not do?  And  this is why the example cuts the other way. They never gave the president any sort of  delegation of tariff authority at the time.  Our point is not you can't delegate tariff authority.  It's simply that you've got to do so with intelligible principles.  And  what you just heard my friend say is every single limit in IEEPA is one that is not judicially enforceable, there's no limit  whatsoever, and, indeed, the main limit that was in there  -- he calls this some compromise position  -- the only compromise in 1977 was the legislative veto.

If this  statute came out of nowhere in 1977, I think your case would be, you know, obviously stronger.  We have to figure out, at least I  want to figure out, what the Nixon precedent stands for and what Algonquin stands for.  On the Nixon precedent, the question is, I think, was Congress aware of that? Meaning that when they used \"regulate importation\" and it's now being used to encompass tariffs, that's not unheralded because Congress was well aware  --you know, President Nixon announced those tariffs in a nationwide prime -time speech, 10 percent across the board in August 1971.  It was not some kind of little piece of paper.  So it was well-known. The question then is, was Congress -- why didn't they change the language?  Why didn't they say \"regulate\" but not \"tariffs\"? That's kind of the  --the difficult question from the Nixon precedent that I'll give you an opportunity --"

And then, even if you thought that Congress knew about Yoshida and even if you thought they liked it, which there's absolutely zero evidence of, I don't think that helps the government for reasons that Justice Alito was pointing to because Yoshida said three things: (a)  TWEA doesn't give the unlimited authority that the government is seeking here; (b) they were only upholding the -- the limited specific assertion of authority that President Nixon sought there; and, third, going forward, the solution they said in Footnote 33 was to use Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, 15 percent, 150 days.  So we have no problem with the President doing that.  It's just that this President has torn up the entire tariff architecture.  You know, for example, he's  tariffing Switzerland, one of our allies, which we have a trade surplus, 39 percent.  That is just not something that any president has ever had the power to do in our history.  And the idea that Congress, by implication, did this in 1977 and handed him all this power, I think, is really difficult."

So, you know, as Justice Jackson said, it's  -- when you're in an emergency situation, the statutes actually have to speak with more precision.  The public needs to know because emergencies beget emergencies. And I would say the best way of understanding what Congress does in emergencies is to look at their emergency statutes.  Not  one has ever given the president a taxation power or a tariff power.  We've had all sorts of emergencies for 238 years.  No president has  ever said, oh, the way to deal with that is I need to have a tariff authority.  And, as Justice Sotomayor said, IEEPA gives already a quota power.  So you can get what the foreign policy piece of it is through that.  I'd also say, Justice Alito, Dames Moore, which the Chief Justice referred to earlier, I think is really important here because the Solicitor General in that case made  a similar argument to what you just heard on -- on the claims provisions.  He said it falls within \"regulate.\"  \"Regulate\" is a capacious term.  He said, Justice Alito, what you said, this is an emergency situation.  And he said  you've got to defer to the President on a major issue of national security about this very statute.  And what did the Court do?  It  rejected those arguments and said IEEPA doesn't cover this --"

The idea that three years later they just said, oh, no, junk the rule book, I think  is very difficult, and no Congress, I think, would rely just on the legislative veto for such  --a thing of such momentous importance. As you said to my colleague earlier, why would any president look to -- look to all of the different tariff statutes in Title 19 if you can just IEEPA them all, French Revolution them all."

It was challenged.  It got to this Court.  The  attorneys standing where you are stood up and said  \"the license fee now before the Court involves the broadest exercise of the tariff power in the history of the American republic. In fact, we would have to go back to George the III's stamp tax to determine as broad an executive power as claimed in this case.  The statute is the simple one.  It does not mention the tariff on its face.\"  The argument there was the word \"tariff\" was not mentioned, it used \"adjust imports.\"  The Court, obviously 9 -0, rejects that argument, in part because, as others have  --have pointed out, the Court does a lot of questioning, well, what's the difference between a quota and a tariff and what's the difference between an embargo and a tariff?  And so, when -- when the Court writes the opinion, it says, \"We find no support in  the language of the statute,\" the language,  \"for respondents' contention that the authorization of the President to 'adjust' imports should be read to encompass only quantitative methods  --i.e., quotas  -- as opposed to monetary methods  -- i.e., license fees  --if affecting such adjustments.\" So, on your basic point that you need the word \"tariff,\" Algonquin says you don't need the word \"tariff.\"  And that was President Ford's oil imports.

So I'd also say, and maybe the most important point, 232 -- our point -- our argument is not just that you have to specifically authorize a tariff with some  sort of word but also that one way of understanding whether Congress is delegating its awesome tariff power, its awesome taxing power is to ask are there limits to what  Congress has put in.  And in Algonquin, in Section 232, the Court points to and goes painstakingly through  all the limits.  The first words of the decision are all about how constrained the statute is.  It's a reticulated scheme.  The  cabinet secretaries have to make certain findings.  There are specific statutory factors  Congress says the President must look at before acting.  There are public hearings.  There are  limited remedies \"to the extent necessary.\"  All of that is in the statute.  All of that is in the Algonquin opinion.  None of it is in IEEPA.  That's the problem.  And that's why just like Dames Moore, the Algonquin case said this is a very limited decision limited just to the facts."

But, for our case, the way it would work is, in this case, the government's stipulated for the five plaintiffs that they would get their refunds.  So, for us, that's  how it would work.  Your question, I take it, is about everyone else where you don't have a class action or anything like that.  With respect to everyone else, there's a whole specialized body of trade law.  And 19 U.S.C.  1514 outlines all these administrative procedures.  It's a very complicated thing.  There's got to be an administrative protest. There was a Harbor Management case earlier that this Court was involved with in United States  Shoe in which, you know, the refund process took a long time.

So they've used it for quotas, like limitations on the number of goods.  They've used it for screening and reporting  requirements, like Executive Order 12284 about reporting property of the shah.  And they've  used it for standards, like domestic safety standards, environmental standards, labor requirements.  They've used it for embargoes.  So all of those are things that I think Congress had in mind in IEEPA.  And I think the proof of this, that it's not this massive statute that allows the government to do anything, is Dames  Moore itself, because this Court rejected the idea that \"regulate\" includes the claims extinguishment that was at issue in that case.  It's a much more limited statute.  And, Justice Jackson, there was a predecessor Justice Jackson who said -- who said, you know, that, \"For all its defects,  delays, and inconveniences, men have discovered no technique for long preserving free  government except that the Executive be under the law and that the law be made by parliamentary deliberations.  Such institutions  may be destined to pass away, but it is the duty of [this] Court to be last, not first, to give [it] up.\"  And I take it my friend's argument on the other side is in deep tension with Youngstown and that canonical principle."

The --the 19th century cases about the President's inherent Article II authority to  --with respect to -- in a wartime with respect to importation is -- is not the power  to impose tariffs on imports coming into the  --the United States. That is not what any of those cases were about.  They were about the President's power, you know, in a wartime as an occupying military force to impose tariffs in occupied territory, in Mexico, in the Philippines, in California.  The Civil War case might be the closest case, but even there, what we were talking about were essentially -- there were licensing fees, but they were export fees.  They were fees that were being imposed on the exportation of cotton from the occupied South into the North.  And so I don't think any of that provides authority for this general notion that there is a background principle that the President, even in wartime, has an Article II  authority to impose tariffs, certainly without the consent of Congress."

It does seem to me, tell me if I'm wrong, that a really key part of the context here, if not the dispositive one for you, is the constitutional assignment of the taxing power to Congress.  The power to reach into the pockets of the American people is just  different and it's been different since the founding and the navigation acts that were part of the spark of the American Revolution, where Parliament asserted the power to tax to regulate commerce.  Some of those were revenue-raising.  Some of them didn't raise a lot of revenue.  We had a lot of pirates in America at the time.  And -- and Americans thought even Parliament couldn't do that, that that had to  be done locally through our elected representatives.  Isn't that really the major questions, nondelegation now, whatever you want to describe it, isn't that what's really animating your argument today?"

                "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  Just three points.  One an interpretive point.  The statutory language  here is \"regulate importation\" and, again, by means of instruments, licenses, or otherwise. Their argument is that that phrase carries with  it a whole host of unemunerated forms of regulation, including quotas, licenses,  licenses apparently that come with fees as long as they're not -- as long as they're sort of profit -neutral fees, environmental restrictions, qualitative restrictions, reports and so forth.  It's just that the one form of regulation that they would not include is  tariff regulation, which, of course, is the quintessential most historically tested method of regulating imports.  And so that  -- that -- that  --that additional phrase about, you know, by means of instruments, licenses, or otherwise really sort of reinforces the plain meaning,  the ordinary natural meaning of \"regulated importation\" here.  So, when it comes just to the plain text of the statute, their argument is a donut-type argument, and it's not an argument that does justice to the statute's plain text.  On the nondelegation point, Justice Gorsuch, you alluded to the founding or delegations of the Indian commerce power, and I just remind the Court that in 1790, in July of 1790, Congress passed a statute that essentially delegated to President Washington  essentially the entire scope of the Indian commerce power.  He said you can do commerce with Indians if you have a license that you had to pay a fee for, but  --and that -- that will be subject to such rules and regulations as the  President makes with no further guidance.  So, when it comes to this foreign-facing, there, it's obviously analogous because the Indian tribes are not foreign sovereigns, but this foreign-facing situation, we have a very sort of deep and profound historical pedigree through broad delegations  of the regulation of commerce, right, the foreign commerce power in that case, the Indian commerce power.  And that ties, I think, to what I take to be the main theme of the arguments on the other side.  And I think that Mr. Katyal started by saying tariffs are taxes.  And I  want to complete the answer I think I was giving to the Chief Justice when I got interrupted, is if you look at these, these tariffs, these policies, it is clear that these policies are most effective if nobody ever pays the tariff.  If it never raises a dime of  revenue, these are the most effective use of these -- of this particular policy.  And I said there's two buckets there. One is, first of all, when it comes to the  trade deficit emergency, if no one ever pays the tariff, but, instead, they direct their consumption domestically and spur the creation or the rebuilding of our -- of our hollowed-out manufacturing base, that directly addresses the crisis.  It's more effective if no one ever pays the tariff.  That's the point of it, really.  You know, that's a fundamental point  of it.  And that's one piece of these.  And then, as to both of them, as to both of the declared emergencies, the tariffs are an incentive, a pressure point, leverage, bargaining chip, as the Court said in Dames Moore, to get countries to change their behavior to address the foreign-arising emergencies.  So, if you look, for example, to take a historical example, last week's trade deal with China, it unlocked access to rare earth minerals, which, of course, have a  critical national security aspect to them, and it got China for the very first time to change its policy with respect to fentanyl precursors, which is a crucial piece of that.  That -- those tariffs, if no one ever collects them, but the threat of imposing those  tariffs gets China and our other trading partners across the world to change their  behaviors in a way that addresses this, then that's the most effective use of the policy. So they're clearly regulatory tariffs, not taxes.  They are not  --they're not an exercise of the power to tax.  They are the exercise of the power to regulate foreign commerce.  And that's why the statute says \"regulate.\"  It doesn't say \"tax.\"  It says \"regulate.\"  And -- and for that reason, we are squarely within the tradition that I was  talking about before of very broad, historically very broad, delegations of the power to regulate foreign commerce to the  President because he has inherent Article II authority in the area of  -- of -- of -- of foreign affairs, although not that.  It has to be delegated to him.  Otherwise, the delegate  -- delegation would be superfluous. And for all those reasons, we ask the Court to reverse both the decisions below."
