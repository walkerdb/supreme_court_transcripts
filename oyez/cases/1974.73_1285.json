  "conclusion": "<p>No. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the common law doctrine of immunity for public school officials provided immunity from liability if the school board acted in good faith. To impose a penalty of liability for such a decision would make the board vulnerable to intimidation. The Court also held that, to prove the board acted in bad faith, the evidence must show that the school board members knew or should have known that their actions would violate the constitutional rights of the students. Given the information available to the school board at the time of the decision, the Court found that the school board acted in good faith. The Court also held the United States Court of Appeals went beyond its purview by reinterpreting the school board statute. </p>\n<p>Justice Lewis F. Powell wrote on opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. He agreed that the case should be remanded but argued that the majority’s opinion placed too high a burden on school board officials by equating ignorance of the law with malicious intent. He cited recent split decisions on the part of the Court as evidence that even knowledge of the law did not necessarily lead to an understanding of a clear course of action. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Justice Harry A. Blackmun, and Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n",
  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Peggy Strickland and Virginia Crain were sophomores at Mena Public High School in Mena, Arkansas. They heard about a school meeting where both parents and students would be present and decided to spike the punch with alcohol. Ten days later, Mrs. Curtis Powell, a teacher at the high school, learned of the prank and confronted the girls. The girls confessed based on the understanding that she would handle their punishment. The next day, the teacher informed the girls that the principal, P. T. Waller, heard about the incident and she would not be able to help them unless they confessed to the principal. The girls did so, and Mr. Waller suspended them for two weeks pending a decision by the school board. The school board voted to suspend the girls for the rest of the semester. The girls, their parents, and their counsel were present at a subsequent meeting to ask the board to reconsider the suspensions. The board denied the request.</p>\n<p>Strickland and Crain sued the members of the school board, administrators, and the school district of Mena, Arkansas for damages resulting from their suspension, which they claimed violated their right to due process. The jury could not reach a verdict and a mistrial was declared. The district court directed a verdict for the school board because there was no evidence of malice toward the girls. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and ordered a new trial. </p>\n",
