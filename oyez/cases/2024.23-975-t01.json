I mean, I understood that an EIS, based on what even Public Citizen said, is about the usefulness of any new potential information to the decision-making process, and the agency is making a determination about that. And so, in Kleppe, we said that NEPA analysis requires a high level of expertise and is properly left to the informed discretion of responsible federal agencies. So I was just curious as to your decision to sort of propose a new test outside of this deference framework, as opposed to just saying the problem here is that the D.C. Circuit did not give the agency sufficient deference, as we have said they're supposed to do."

So, like, there still would be a role for NEPA in this kind of narrower view, but I -- I do think that sort of historical perspective is important because, when NEPA was first passed, there were very few substantive environmental statutes, and so it was really designed to make sure that the agencies weren't heedless of the environmental consequences.

So I  -- I'm trying to figure out how to best articulate the concern, but your focus is on identifying who is legally responsible if this were to go wrong, as if NEPA is about solely mitigation measures. I thought NEPA was about the agency who has some responsibility over an aspect of this project determining whether or not to approve it, and it's got to take into account not only the environmental consequences of the actual building of its piece but whatever approving its piece is going to have happen in the environment broader than that. Now I understand that's really hard to do, it gets far afield, and we can fight about the extent of that."

And we start with the deference on the arbitrary and capricious standard, but given the uncertain lines that were reflected in your answers to Justice Barrett and Justice  Kagan and Justice Jackson about how far to go, it seems to me the deference of the courts has to be huge with respect to how the agencies think about the scope of what they're going to consider.

Mr. Clement says:  No problem, harmless error, because NEPA didn't require you to study that at all. And that, we think, is the wrong way to  -- to attack the problem because the reasonable foreseeability standard is in the statute, and  -- and this sort of alternative \"not my problem\" standard is not. If anything, the text of  -- as Justice Sotomayor brought out at the very beginning of the argument, the text of the statute directs agencies not to ask do I have the  -- the statutory authority to  -- to mitigate this issue?  It ask  -- it directs the federal government together to  -- to bring together all agencies that have jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved.

And I think that there's both a NEPA problem and a Chenery problem with  -- with doing that. The  -- the NEPA problem is that it doesn't apply the actual foreseeability standard in the statute and that where the agency has concluded that  -- that effects are foreseeable and that it should or indeed must tackle them, that to have the courts come in and say, no, that's  -- that's not what's required, I think, should require a higher standard and not a lesser one. And the second is  -- is a principle about Chenery, which is that this is essentially  -- like, not even the government is here defending the  -- the agency's rationale.

I mean, as I said a moment ago and I think this really is one of the most important pieces of this case, that how much the agency has to do under NEPA is different from saying that certain effects are beyond the scope of NEPA so that Mr. Clement's aggressive view of harmless error can come in and over --  and fix an agency's flawed decision-making on grounds that the agency itself did not give. That  -- that, I think, is  -- is the core of the point, that even -- even where some agency has  -- some other agency has responsibility, the first --  that agency is going to be at the table in the NEPA review. The first agency may well be able to rely on the  -- on the agency with expertise in the NEPA review, and the flip side of that  -- and this is made explicit in the 2023 amendments  -- is that where the first NEPA review answers these questions, the second agency can look back to the first NEPA review and say we're all done here."

The second point I'd like to make is just to be specific about what's wrong with Sabal Trail, in addition to its decision to disregard FERC's judgment that the EIS there was enough. I mean,  first of all, it decouples reasonable foreseeability from environmental effects, and that's what the Respondents do as well."
