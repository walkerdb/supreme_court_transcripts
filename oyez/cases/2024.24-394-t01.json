I don't --I -- I appreciate the Trinity Lutheran scenario and it not being a compelling interest to prevent religious schools from doing exactly the same thing as everybody else is doing in this program, but I'm actually drawing a distinction, as you've heard me say  before, that what the religious schools are asking for here is not exactly the same thing. And so, to the extent that the state is saying we see a distinction between religious schools, which require all of these religious rights and proselytize and do whatever, we see a distinction between those kinds of schools and public schools, and we only want to set up public schools because our compelling interest is to prevent the entanglement of the state with funding those kinds of schools."
