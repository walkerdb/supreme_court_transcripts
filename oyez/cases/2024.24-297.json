  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In October 2022, Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland approved LGBTQ-inclusive books for its English Language Arts curriculum. These \u201cStorybooks\u201d featured characters and themes related to sexual orientation and gender identity, including books like \u201cPride Puppy!\u201d for pre-K students and \u201cBorn Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope\u201d for K-5 students. Initially, the school board allowed parents to receive notice and opt their children out of lessons involving these books, in line with the district\u2019s guidelines for religious accommodations. However, in March 2023, the Board abruptly reversed this policy, eliminating all notice and opt-out options without explanation, though they later cited concerns about high student absenteeism, classroom disruption, administrative burden, and potential stigmatization of individuals represented in the books.</p>\n<p>Several parents of different religious backgrounds (Muslim, Roman Catholic, and Ukrainian Orthodox) sued the Board, arguing that the denial of notice and opt-out options violated their religious freedom and parental rights. The parents did not seek to ban the books or challenge their adoption into the curriculum; rather, they sought to maintain control over how and when their children would be exposed to content they believed conflicted with their religious duties to train their children according to their faiths on matters of gender, marriage, and sexuality.</p>\n<p>The district court denied the parents\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, finding the parents failed to demonstrate a cognizable burden to their religious freedom, and the parents filed an interlocutory appeal, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s denial.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Do public schools burden parents\u2019 religious exercise when they compel elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents\u2019 religious convictions and without notice or opportunity to opt out?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>Parents challenging the Montgomery County Board of Education\u2019s introduction of certain \u201cLGBTQ+-inclusive\u201d storybooks, along with the Board\u2019s decision to withhold parental opt outs from that instruction, are entitled to a preliminary injunction because the policy poses \u201ca very real threat of undermining\u201d the religious beliefs and practices parents wish to instill. Justice Samuel Alito authored the 6-3 majority opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Montgomery County Board of Education introduced LGBTQ+-inclusive storybooks into its elementary school English curriculum and initially allowed parents to opt their children out of related instruction. When the Board rescinded this opt-out policy, citing administrative burdens and concerns about classroom disruption, parents from diverse religious backgrounds sued. The Court applied the principle from Wisconsin v. Yoder that government policies violate parents\u2019 free exercise rights when they \u201csubstantially interfere with the religious development\u201d of children by placing them in environments \u201chostile\u201d to their religious beliefs with \u201cpressure to conform\u201d to contrary viewpoints. The storybooks present normative messages about same-sex marriage and gender identity that directly contradict the religious teachings these parents seek to instill. Combined with teacher guidance that encourages specific responses reinforcing these viewpoints, the curriculum creates precisely the kind of \u201cobjective danger to the free exercise of religion\u201d that the First Amendment prohibits.</p>\n<p>When a burden on religious exercise matches the character found in Yoder\u2014substantial interference with parents\u2019 ability to guide their children's religious development\u2014strict scrutiny applies regardless of whether the policy is neutral and generally applicable. While schools have a compelling interest in maintaining an undisrupted educational environment, the Board\u2019s no-opt-out policy fails narrow tailoring. The Board continues to permit opt-outs for other curricula, including family life and human sexuality instruction, and provides parallel programming for other student populations. The Board cannot create administrative burdens through its own curriculum design choices and then cite those burdens to justify denying constitutional rights. The availability of private school or homeschooling does not cure the constitutional violation, as public education is a public benefit that cannot be conditioned on surrendering religious exercise rights.</p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas authored a concurring opinion arguing that the Board\u2019s policy represents an impermissible attempt at ideological conformity comparable to that rejected in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, and that sex education for young children lacks the historical pedigree necessary to override parents\u2019 fundamental rights.</p>\n<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor authored a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, arguing that mere exposure to ideas conflicting with religious beliefs does not constitute a Free Exercise violation under established precedent, and warning that the majority\u2019s ruling will create administrative chaos for public schools while effectively granting religious parents a veto over curricular decisions traditionally left to democratically elected school boards.</p>\n",
