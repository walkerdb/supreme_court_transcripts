  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In 1993, a tax auditor for the Franchise Tax Board of California (FTB) read a newspaper about Gilbert P. Hyatt, an inventor, and the large amounts of money he was making from the patent. The auditor decided to investigate Hyatt, and, after finding some discrepancies, opened an audit on Hyatt\u2019s 1991 state tax return. In conducting the audit, the auditor found additional discrepancies\u00a0 surrounding Hyatt\u2019s move from California to Nevada and opened an audit as to his 1992 tax returns. FTB determined that Hyatt owed $1.8 million in state income taxes, plus $1.4 million in penalties and $1.2 million in interest, resulted in a tax assessment of $4.5 million for Hyatt\u2019s 1991 tax year. FTB further found that Hyatt owed over $6 million in taxes and interest for 1992, plus penalties.</p>\n<p>Hyatt challenged the conclusions by filing protests with FTB and then in California courts. In 1998, Hyatt sued FTB in Nevada state court seeking damages for intentional torts and bad-faith conduct allegedly committed by FTB auditors during tax audits of Hyatt\u2019s 1991 and 1992 state tax returns.</p>\n<p>FTB filed a motion for partial summary judgment challenging the Nevada district court\u2019s jurisdiction over Hyatt\u2019s declaratory relief cause of action. The district court granted partial summary judgment, finding that the timing of Hyatt\u2019s move from California to Nevada should be resolved via the administrative investigation. FTB also asked the Nevada Supreme Court to decide whether it was entitled to complete immunity under several theories: it enjoyed complete immunity under California law, it was entitled to sovereign immunity, the Full Faith and Credit Clause, and comity. The Nevada Supreme Court concluded FTB was not entitled to complete immunity under any of these principles, but was entitled to partial immunity equal to the immunity a Nevada government agency would receive. Thus, the court concluded that FTB was immune from the negligence cause of action, but not from the intentional tort causes of action.</p>\n<p>FTB appealed to the US Supreme Court, and the Court upheld the court\u2019s determination that FTB was entitled only to partial immunity under comity principles. Two other questions from this litigation made their way to the US Supreme Court, and the Court (1) split 4\u20134 as to whether it should overrule <em>Nevada v. Hall</em>, which provides \u201cthat one State \u2026 can open the doors of its courts to a private citizen\u2019s lawsuit against another State \u2026 without the other State\u2019s consent,\u201d and (2) held that the Constitution does not permit Nevada to award damages against California agencies under its state law that are greater than it could award against Nevada agencies in similar circumstances. With these preliminary legal questions resolved, a Nevada jury finally found in favor of Hyatt and awarded him $85 million for emotional distress, $52 million for invasion of privacy, over $1 for special damages for fraud, and $250 million in punitive damages. The Nevada Supreme Court issued upholding the damages, subject to the statutory caps to which FTB is entitled, consistent with the US Supreme Court\u2019s holding on that issue.</p>\n<p>FTB asked the US Supreme Court to reconsider the first question again, whether to overrule <em>Nevada v. Hall</em>.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Should the Court overrule its prior decision in <em>Nevada v. Hall</em>, which permits a sovereign state to be haled into another state\u2019s courts without its consent?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p><a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1978/77-1337\"><em>Nevada v. Hall</em>, 440 US 410 (1979)</a>, is overruled; states are immune from suit in the courts of other states. Justice Clarence Thomas delivered the opinion for a 5-4 majority.</p>\n<p>The Court criticized the <em>Hall</em> decision as \u201cmisread[ing] the historical record and misapprehend[ing] the constitutional design created by the Framers.\u201d The Court found that it was \u201cwell settled\u201d at the time of the founding that states were immune from suit and the Constitution preserved this broad immunity, except in a very narrow set of circumstances. The Court further found state sovereign immunity from suit \u201cintegral to the structure of the Constitution.\u201d Finally, given that the principle of stare decisis is \u201cat its weakest when interpreting the Constitution\u201d the Court determined that <em>Nevada v. Hall</em> should be overruled.</p>\n<p>Justice Stephen Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan joined. The dissent argued that the Court in <em>Hall</em> clearly answered the very same question\u2014whether the Constitution requires or merely permits a state to grant another state immunity from suit in its courts\u2014and there is no good reason to overrule the decision in that case.\u00a0</p>\n",
